# Mutation Testing on Java Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project implements **Mutation Testing** on a set of algorithms written in **Java** to evaluate the effectiveness of unit tests in detecting faults introduced by small mutations in the source code. The goal of this project is to apply mutation testing techniques using the **PIT Mutation Testing Tool** and assess the robustness of the unit tests for various algorithms.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Java**: The programming language used to implement and test the algorithms.
- **PIT Mutation Testing Tool**: A mutation testing tool for Java that automates the process of generating mutants and evaluates the effectiveness of unit tests.
- **JUnit**: A testing framework for Java, used to define unit tests for the algorithms.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool for Java that was used to integrate the PIT tool.
